## What This Project Does

This lab uses pretrained GloVe word embeddings (100D) to build two models on a movie dataset:

1. **Regression** – predict a movie's rating from its text (overview / tagline / keywords)
2. **Genre Classification** – predict which genres a movie belongs to (multi-label)

We also do some text analysis to find which words are most common and most indicative per genre.

## Dataset

[Kaggle Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/figolm10/moviedataset)  
Columns used: `overview`, `tagline`, `keywords`, `genre`, `voting_average`

---

## How It Works

- Text is cleaned (lowercase, remove punctuation/numbers, lemmatize)
- Each document is converted to a 100D vector using **TF-IDF weighted GloVe averaging** — rare, distinctive words get more weight than common ones
- A small MLP neural network is trained separately for each text column
- Data split: 70% train / 15% val / 15% test
